## How it works

```
appa "add dark mode support to the settings page"
```

1. **You invoke** — describe what you want in natural language

2. **Local agent plans** — a coding agent breaks it down into a structured plan

3. **Issue created** — the plan becomes a [Linear](https://linear.app) issue automatically

4. **Remote agent builds** — a server-side agent picks it up and implements

5. **PR opens** — you review the result on GitHub

```
☁️  Planning...
